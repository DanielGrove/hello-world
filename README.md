# hello-world

Hello folks! 

My name is Daniel Grove and welcome to my little corenr of the internet. As you will see
from my github profile that I have my hands into a lot of things. I am primarally an in
house FileMaker developer for a leading rigging company. I like digging my hands into
eveything on the fringes of FileMaker.
